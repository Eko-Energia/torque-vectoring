/**

 * The real-time path uses fixed physical units and contains no floating-point
 * operations, dynamic allocation, or dependency on math.h/libm/arm_math.
 * All arithmetic is 32-bit: no 64-bit types appear even in intermediate
 * results, so no software 64-bit helpers (__aeabi_uldivmod and similar) are
 * linked on 32-bit cores. This requires the physical parameter bounds
 * documented on VehicleParameters; the kinematics functions reject speeds
 * above TV_CONFIG_MAX_SPEED_MMPS.
